# Voice Controlled Hands Free Assistant

A Fully Voice Controlled Platform with Ability to set and Read Out pending Reminders along with real time object detection to make Blind People aware of their surrounding.

Blind People face the eternal darkness. But they are not alone. With HAFISTANT, they can be aware of their surrounding and lead safer and better lives.

These are currently "STATIC".

2. "Assistant Set Reminder [ REMINDER ]" : Set Reminders that you can ask later to the assistant and Assistant will read them out.

3. "Read out Reminders" : Assistant reads out Reminders that you have saved.

4. "Reset Reminders" : All of your Reminders are cleared and you can start from the beginning.
